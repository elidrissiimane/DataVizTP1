# Work on Flow Chart
## Historical examples
A flowchart is a type of diagram that represents an algorithm, workflow or process, showing the steps as boxes of various kinds, and their order by connecting them with arrows. This diagrammatic representation illustrates a solution model to a given problem. Flowcharts are used in analyzing, designing, documenting or managing a process or program in various fields.

    </td>
     <td>
       <p>Flowline : Shows the program's order of operation. A line coming from one symbol and ending at another.Arrowheads are added if the flow is not the standard top-to-bottom, left-to right.</p>

    </td>
     <td>
       <p>Decision : Conditional operation determining which of two paths the program will take. The operation is commonly a yes/no question or true/false test. Represented as a diamond (rhombus).</p>
